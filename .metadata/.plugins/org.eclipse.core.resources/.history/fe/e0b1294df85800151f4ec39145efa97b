/**
 * Java Secure Coding Rule: IDS00-J. Prevent SQL Injection
 * <p>
 * SQL injection vulnerabilities arise in applications where elements of a SQL query originate
 * from an untrusted source. Without precautions, the untrusted data may maliciously alter
 * the query, resulting in information leaks or data modification. The primary means of preventing
 * SQL injection are sanitization and validation, which are typically implemented as parameterized
 * queries and stored procedures.
